    <TextHeading class="mt-5">Sponsors</TextHeading>
    <TextParagraph>
      We wouldn’t be able to organize Hack Kosice without the help from our
      sponsors. Sponsors, in exchange, will have access to the CV and other
      information you provide us. We, or our partners, may perform processing on
      and make use of the data within the CV you have submitted for recruiting
      purposes, for example to send you a job offer.
    </TextParagraph>

    <TextHeading class="mt-5">Media and publicity</TextHeading>
    <TextParagraph>
      We take and publish photos throughout the hackathon and other events
      organised by us. You may appear on some of these photos. We aim to publish
      photos that show everyone at their best, but there might be a few that you
      don’t like. If you see a photo like this, let us know so that we can try
      to take it down — but be aware that it is difficult to completely erase a
      photo from all media channels. These images will be used to share news
      about Hack Kosice, and to publicise our future events. Images may be used
      in press releases, printed publicity and published on our social media. If
      you would like to see your images or would like us to delete them, please
      write email to
      <Link
        title="contact@hackkosice.com"
        link="mailto:contact@hackkosice.com"
        :external="true"
      />. We will publish the names of the winners and the winning hacks. We may
      publish other content associated with this, such as videos of the winners
      presenting.
    </TextParagraph>

    <TextHeading class="mt-5">Running the event</TextHeading>
    <TextParagraph>
      When you apply to the event, we collect information about you that is

      date of birth, email, phone number, age, gender, institution, study level,
      major, graduation year, shirt size, dietary restrictions, and any special
      needs you have entered on your profile. When you give us your consent we
      will also collect optional data, e.g. your CV. During the application
      process, we also collect your submissions to the questions we ask,
      including information about your interests, and the country you are
      travelling from. We store your RSVP status and your attendee status. We
      use this information for running the Service and for sharing anonymised
      aggregate data with media organisations for the purposes of promoting Hack
      Kosice. We may share anonymised data about your dietary requirements with
      third parties for catering purposes.

    <TextParagraph>
      We may employ third party companies and individuals, to facilitate our
      Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related
      services or to assist us in analysing how our Service is used. These third

      not have a data protection regulation equivalent to the European (“Third
      Countries”). These service providers have signed the confidentiality and
      data processing agreements required by the regulation, which apply the
      warranties and safeguards needed to preserve your privacy. Your
      information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to — and
      maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country
      or other governmental jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy
      followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement
      to that transfer.
